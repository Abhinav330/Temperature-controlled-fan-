# Temperature-controlled-fan-
# Arduino project , diy project
arduino project .Temperature controlled fan system with Arduino.  this system have 2 modes of operation, 1.Automatic mode and, 2. Manual mode.

System Discription:

This system have 2 mode of operation:
     1. Automatic mode :
       * Fan speed control on the basis of temperature of environment.
       * DHT11 temperature sensor is used for getting temprature values from environment.
       * speed of fan is pre-defined from the code. 
     2. Manual mode :
       * speed of fan is controled by a potentiometer.
       * Potentiometer(10k pot) is used as a knob to regulate temperature
       *speed of fan depends on users wish.
       
This system have a switch for changing the mode of operation and there are 2 Leds for indicating in which mode our system is. and there is a OLED display which will display temperature , fan speed and mode of operation.
